1. Define a port to a server that will first answer request regarding frequency and the binary code for alphabet received from user
 - Create m threads that will connect to server that is gonna answer the request
 - Same server, create m threads to communicate with m processes on server that is gonna get the code assigned to decompressed message
2. TCP Protocol Sockets will be used
3. Technically only need to send char array, integer values and characters through sockets
4. Our server will be returning characters based on the symbol being passed by client
 - Client will pass set of bits and server will return character
 - Create multiple child threads on client side
 - Create multiple processes on server side to handle the requests
5. Use fireman function
6. Clent server will send request to server asking for number of bits (main thread can do this)
 - Response from server will be integer value representing the number of bits
 - Then create m threads from previous pa1
  - Each thread will get char and save that char to location that is accessible to main thread then print that info later
  - Each child thread will create a socket, then will send binary code to server then wait for server to answer request with character then save the character to a location accessible by main thread
 - When all child threads are done, main thread prints decompressed message
7. Server side will have 2 types of requests
 - No need for threads on server side
 - Will read info about each character (decimal value of each character)
 - Call bin function to translate it to binary then determine size(num of bits) of each char
 - When alphabet and num of bits are ready, will receive 2 types of requests
  - 1st request from client will be num of bits
  - 2nd request will be m requests from client where each request will be a child thread asking for the char based on string we're receiving
 - Make sure on infinite loop after accept, call fork() because each request will be handled by different process
  - If type of request == 0 then return num of bits
  - If type or request == 1 then you translate the character array were receiving into char then return char
 - M + 1 processes
  - Use fireman function to handle zombie processes
